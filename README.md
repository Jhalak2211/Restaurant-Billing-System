**Restaurant Billing System**

This is a Restaurant Billing System built using Java Swing.
I used JCheckBox for selecting food items, JTextField for quantity input, and JTextArea to display the bill.
When the Generate Bill button is clicked, ActionListener checks which items are selected and calculates the total amount accordingly.
